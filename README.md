FETCH3.14 is a tree hydrodynamic model for water fluxes across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. FETCH3.14 simulates water
transport through the soil, roots, and xylem as flow through porous media. The model resolves water potentials along the
vertical dimension, and stomatal response is linked to xylem water potential.

For instructions and additional information, please see the [FETCH3.14 documentation](https://fetch3-nhl.readthedocs.io/).
